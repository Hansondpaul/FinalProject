# Project Title and purpose

One Paragraph of project description goes here

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The toughest part was...

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.

```Java
void keyPressed() {
if (keyCode == LEFT) {
   tree= tree.getLeft();
   System.out.println(tree.getValue());
   String s=(String)tree.getValue();
   fill(155);
   textSize(50);
} else if (keyCode == RIGHT) {
   tree = tree.getRight();
   System.out.println(tree.getValue());
   String s=(String)tree.getValue();
   fill(155);
   textSize(50);
} else if (tree.getLeft()==null&&tree.getRight()==null) {
   System.out.println(tree.getValue());
   tree=t.returnTree();
}
}
```
This is the code that moves down the tree as decisions are made. It gets each value from both left and right and also casts the value to a String. If the progressions arrives at the leaf nodes, those values are printed.
